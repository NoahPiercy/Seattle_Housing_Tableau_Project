## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 to 2017 and developing a dashboard to present housing-related information. The objective is to extract insights from the dataset and visually convey them through the dashboard.
## Objectives
- Analyze the prices in different areas
- Identify the Revenue made from the Airbnb's
- Identify the various types of beds available in each Airbnb and the Prices for these Airbnb's
- Determine the total number of listings available
## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
- Dataset Link: [Seattle Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)
## Analyze the prices in different areas
To determine prices across various areas in Seattle, I analyzed the different zip codes, calculated the average Airbnb prices for each, and presented the findings using these two components.

## Identify Revenue Made from Airbnb's in 2016
To assess Airbnb revenue in 2016, I calculated the total earnings for every two-week period throughout the year and showcased the results using this component.

## Identify the various types of beds available in each Airbnb and the Prices for these Airbnb's
To determine the number of beds in Airbnbs and their corresponding prices, I analyzed the average price per bed and displayed the findings using this component.

## Determine the Total Number of Listings Available
To calculate the total number of available listings, I analyzed all the listings for the year and categorized them based on the number of beds in each listing. This helped me determine the total number of Airbnbs as well as the number of bedrooms each Airbnb offers, and this is shown in this component.
